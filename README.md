## ðŸŒŸ How It Works

- **Create an Anonymous Profile**: No religion or personal info displayed up front â€” just a username.
- **Post a "Unity Story"**: Share a moment where someone from a different faith helped you, where you attended a festival of another religion, or learned something inspiring from another faith tradition.
- **Discover Stories**: Browse an endless feed of inspiring, beautiful, human-centered stories from across the world.
- **Bridge Challenges**: Weekly small challenges that bring people closer â€” like "Attend a festival of another faith," "Cook a dish from another culture," or "Learn a greeting in another language."
- **Unity Map**: A simple world map that shows where positive interactions are happening â€” lighting up the world in real-time.
- **Daily Wisdom**: Each day a quote from various religious texts about peace and unity â€” completely randomized, no preference.

## ðŸ›  Core Mobile Features

- **Post Story**: Photo + Short Text (easy mobile experience)
- **Explore Feed**: Scroll beautiful stories â€” swipe up to keep reading
- **Unity Challenges**: 1-minute missions (learn a new greeting, visit a temple, cook a dish)
- **Impact Map**: Global visualization of cross-religion kindness
- **Daily Quote/Verse**: Each day a quote from various religious texts about peace and unity
